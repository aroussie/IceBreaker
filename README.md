# Icebreaker

Icebreaker is a small application written with the framework Flutter from Google. 
Thanks to Flutter, the app can run on both iOS and Android devices.

## What does the app do?

The purpose of the app is to display icebreaker questions. We've all been in situations at work, at school, or in another activity that put you in a group of people, where we don't know everybody and it's just hard to socialize and get to know each other. This app is made to help with that.

Just run the app, read out loud the question that is dislayed. Answer it it front of everyone so they can start to know you and maybe even ask you questions! 
Then pass the phone to the person next to you. Ask him to tap on the screen to display a new question, and now it's his/her turn to read the question and answer it. 

**Get to know the people around you by breaking the ice!!!**
